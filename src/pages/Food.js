            The food of Tamil Nadu is rich in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian
            food. The diet mainly consists of rice, lentils, legumes with spices
            such as curry leaves, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, garlic etc. Coconut
            is widely used in various forms. People of Tamil Nadu believe that
            serving food to another living being, be it humans or animals, is a
            service to God himself. Therefore, they are incredibly generous when
            it comes to food, whether it is in their homes or temples or even
            restaurants. Traditionally, this south Indian cuisine is served on a
            banana leaf, and people sit on the floor to eat. A typical meal
            consists of Rice, Sambhar(Cuny), two types of vegetables, curd and a
            pickle. Dosas, idlis, Upma, Parota, Sambhar, Rasam, Pongal, are the
            dishes with which the cuisine of Tamil Nadu is identified. Payasam,
            Kesari, Sweet Pongal are the sweet treasures of this cuisine. Filter
            coffee is a speciality of the south-Indian cuisine. The making of
            filter coffee is like a ritual; the coffee beans are first roasted
            and then powdered. They then use a filter set, few scoops of
            powdered coffee and enough amount of boiling water is added to
            prepare a 2 very dark liquid called the decoction. A 3/4 mug of hot
            milk with sugar and a small quantity of decoction is then served in
            Dabarah, a unique Coffee cup
