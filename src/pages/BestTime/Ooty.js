            The best time to visit Ooty is throughout the year as the weather is
            pleasant and great for sightseeing. The temperature usually ranges
            from 5-15 degrees throughout the year with colder nights. However,
            the peak season is from October to June when the weather is pleasant
            and you can get involved in outdoor activities. Ooty can be visited
            during monsoons (if you don't mind the rain) when the freshly washed
            surroundings give Ooty an ethereal charm. The annual Tea and Tourism
            Festival attracts crowds in huge numbers to visit the place and have
            a great time in this wonderful place.
