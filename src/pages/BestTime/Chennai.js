            Winters, the best time to visit Chennai, begin in November and last
            till February. Even the transitional month of October is quite good
            for exploring the city. The weather is quite pleasant with the
            maximum temperature hovering around 30째C and the minimum around
            22째C. Its proximity to the coastline also results in occasional
            rains, but it will not be something that will hamper travel plans to
            a great extent. Kapaleeshwarar temple, Govemment Museum, Fort St
            George, St. Andrews Church, Fort Museum, Nalli Silks, IP:alakshetra
            Foundation, Vivekananda House etc are some of the attractions that
            can be seen when in Chennai. The season is also famous for the array
            of festivals organised in the city like the Dance and Music Festival
            in December, Travel & Tourism Fair and Pongal in January and the
            Natyanjali Dance Festival held in February/ March. These events are
            traditional and important celebrations of Chennai and its culture
            and must not be missed when there.{' '}

          <h6 className="fw-bold">Chennai in Summers (March - June) </h6>
          <p style={{ textIndent: '6rem', textAlign: 'justify' }}>
            March marks the onset of the summer season in Chennai. It lasts till
            June and visiting the city during this time is not for the
            faint-hearted, some say. The days are blazing hot with the
            temperatures soaring as high as 39째C and the nights are equally warm
            with the minimum hovering around 27째C. Exploring the dtyscape during
            this time of the year is an extremely exhausting affair and is,
            therefore, not advised to tourists.{' '}

          <h6 className="fw-bold">Chennai in Monsoons (July - September) </h6>
          <p style={{ textIndent: '6rem', textAlign: 'justify' }}>
            Chennai is susceptible to heavy downpours and cyclones between the
            months of July and September. These months mark the monsoon season
            in the region and is considered off-season as tourism does not
            really thrive here. The extreme rainfalls and strong winds could
            prove to be a hindrance to sightseeing and, therefore, the monsoon
            season is not recommended to tourist. The hotel tariffs, however,
            drop drastically during the season, making it a decent option for
            budget travellers. In case one has to visit Chennai, they may want
            to plan a trip at the onset of the season when the showers are
            moderate and allow travelling through the city.{' '}

            October to February during the winters and the pre-monsoons season
            is the best time to visit Chennai. This time of the year is
            considered as the best time to explore the metropolitan city as
            summers are scorching and monsoons bring torrential downpours and
            cyclones. Its geographical location on the beautiful coastline
            mostly keeps the city's weather hot and humid.
